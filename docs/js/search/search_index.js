Ngx-upload supports drag and drop, upload progress and manages a file upload queue for you.Ngx-upload is bound to anyone presentation framework but you can use it with ng(x)-bootstrap or Angular Material Design without any problems.\nInstallation\nInstall through npm:\nnpm install @wkoza/ngx-uploadOR\nyarn add @wkoza/ngx-uploadSetup\nJust include ngx-upload in your root module with HttpClientModule and (FormsModule or ReactiveFormsModule):\nimport {BrowserModule} from '@angular/platform-browser';import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';import {HttpClientModule} from '@angular/common/http';import {FormsModule} from '@angular/forms';import {NgxUploadModule} from '@wkoza/ngx-upload';@NgModule({  imports: [    BrowserModule,    HttpClientModule,    FormsModule, // or ReactiveFormsModule    NgxUploadModule.forRoot()  ]})export class AppModule {}Ngx-upload also proposes to configure the drop zone aspect. Then, you can change the css class of your drop zone regarding the drop event:\n\nWhen you drag a file\nWhen you drop a file\nIn other cases\n\nFor this, you should add the configuration object DropTargetOptions like this :\nimport {BrowserModule} from '@angular/platform-browser';import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';import {HttpClientModule} from '@angular/common/http';import {FormsModule} from '@angular/forms';import {NgxUploadModule, MineTypeEnum, DropTargetOptions} from '@wkoza/ngx-upload';export const ngxDropTargetOptions: DropTargetOptions = {  color: 'dropZoneColor',  colorDrag: 'dropZoneColorDrag',  colorDrop: 'dropZoneColorDrop',  multiple: true,  accept: [MineTypeEnum.Image, MineTypeEnum.Application_Pdf]};@NgModule({  imports: [    BrowserModule,    HttpClientModule,    FormsModule, // or ReactiveFormsModule    NgxUploadModule.forRoot(ngxDropTargetOptions)  ]})export class AppModule {}In this example, you should also declare these css classes in your own css :\n.dropZoneColor {  border: 3px dotted rgba(0,0,0,0.08);  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.12)}.dropZoneColorDrag {  border: 3px dotted rgba(0,0,0,0.28);  background-color: grey}.dropZoneColorDrop {  border: 3px dotted rgba(0,0,0,0.08);  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.12)}There are also 3 properties:\n\naccept    One or more unique file type specifiers describing file types to allow\ncapture    What source to use for capturing image or video data\nmultiple A Boolean which, if present, indicates that the user may choose more than one file. Default true. \n\nUsage\nDirective ngxDragAndDrop\nNgx-upload offers one directive for your drop zone called ngxDragAndDrop. It allows to add the files in the upload queue. During the drop event, it throws an event called onDrop that you can catch :\nform>...div class=\"my-drop-zone\" ngxDragAndDrop>        Drop files here to uploaddiv>form>To finish, we can overwrite the DropTargetOptions for a specific case with this property binding :\ndiv class=\"my-drop-zone\" [ngxDragAndDrop]=\"options\">        Drop files here to uploaddiv>Directive ngxInputFile\nNgx-upload offers one directive which allows the user to choose one or more files from their device storage.This structural directive can be use like this :\nform>...div class=\"my-drop-zone\" ngxDragAndDrop *ngxInputFile>        Drop files here to uploaddiv>form>or like that with bootstrap:\nform>...span class=\"btn btn-outline-success btn-s\" *ngxInputFile>Upload local filesspan>form>and with Material\nform>...button mat-raised-button [color]=\"'primary'\" >   ng-template ngxInputFile> Upload local filesng-template>button>form>*ngxInputFile supports a configuration object of type InputFileOptions. For instance: \noptionsInput: InputFileOptions = {  multiple: true,  accept: [MineTypeEnum.Image, MineTypeEnum.Application_Pdf]};There are 3 properties:\n\naccept    One or more unique file type specifiers describing file types to allow\ncapture    What source to use for capturing image or video data\nmultiple A Boolean which, if present, indicates that the user may choose more than one file. Default true.\n\nUpload queue\nEach file is added to a queue that you can manage with uploader service. Here is an example :\n  div class=\"col-md-9\" style=\"margin-bottom: 40px\">    h3>Upload queue span *ngIf=\"uploader.queue.length>0\"> - {{ uploader.queue.length }} item(s)span>h3>    div class=\"card text-right\">      div style=\"margin: 15px\">        ngb-progressbar showValue=\"true\" type=\"success\" [striped]=\"true\" [animated]=\"true\"                         [value]=\"uploader.progressTotal\">ngb-progressbar>      div>      div class=\"card-block\">        button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-outline-success btn-s\" (click)=\"uploader.uploadAll({method: 'POST', url: 'my_url'})\"                [disabled]=\"!activeUploadAllBtn()\">          Upload all        button>        button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-outline-warning btn-s\" (click)=\"uploader.cancelAll()\"                [disabled]=\"!activeCancelAllBtn()\">           Cancel all        button>        button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-outline-danger btn-s\" (click)=\"uploader.removeAllFromQueue()\"                [disabled]=\"!activeRemoveAllBtn()\">           Remove all        button>      div>    div>    div class=\"card\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">      table class=\"table\" style=\"font-size: 14px\">        thead>        tr>          th>th>          th width=\"50%\">Nameth>          th>Sizeth>          th>Progressth>          th>Actionsth>        tr>        thead>        tbody>        tr *ngFor=\"let itemFile of uploader.queue\"            [ngClass]=\"{'table-success' : itemFile.isSuccess, 'table-danger' : itemFile.isError, 'table-warning' : itemFile.isUploading  }\">          td>            div [ngxThumbnail]=\"itemFile\">div>          td>          td>{{ itemFile.file.name }}td>          td>{{ itemFile.file.size/1024/1024 | number:'1.0-2' }} MBtd>          td>            div>              ngb-progressbar type=\"success\" showValue=\"true\"                               [striped]=\"true\" [animated]=\"true\"                               [value]=\"itemFile.progress\">              ngb-progressbar>            div>          td>          td style=\"text-align: center\">            button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-outline-success btn-sm\" (click)=\"itemFile.upload({method: 'POST', url: 'my_url'})\"                    [disabled]=\"!itemFile.isReady\">               Upload            button>            button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-outline-warning btn-sm\" (click)=\"itemFile.cancel()\"                    [disabled]=\"!itemFile.uploadInProgress || itemFile.isCancel\">             Cancel            button>            button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-outline-danger btn-sm\" (click)=\"itemFile.remove()\"                    [disabled]=\"itemFile.isSuccess || itemFile.uploadInProgress\">              Remove            button>          td>        tr>        tbody>      table>    div>  div>upload or uploadAll method require a parameter with the type UploadEndPoint. It's your server's endpoint.\nTake a look at those examples for more details :\nHooks\nNgx-upload offers 7 Observable to handle a specific behavior :\n\nonCancel$ : This Observable emits when upload is canceled.\nonError$ : This Observable emits on error during the upload process.\nonSuccess$ : This Observable emits on success.\nonBeforeUploadItem$ : This Observable emits just before the upload process.\nonProgress$ : This Observable emits during the upload process.\nonAddToQueue$>: This Observable is trigged when a file is added in the queue.\nonDropError$: This Observable is trigged when a file is not accepted in the queue.\n\nFor example :\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';import { FileItem, HttpClientUploadService } from '@wkoza/ngx-upload';@Component({    selector: 'app-root',    templateUrl: './simple.component.html',    styleUrls: ['./simple.component.css']})export class SimpleBootstrapComponent implements OnInit {    constructor(public uploader: HttpClientUploadService) { }    ngOnInit() {        this.uploader.onCancel$.subscribe(            (data: FileItem) => {                console.log('file deleted: ' + data.file);            });        this.uploader.onProgress$.subscribe(            (data: any) => {                console.log('upload file in progree: ' + data.progress);            });        this.uploader.onSuccess$.subscribe(            (data: any) => {                console.log(`upload file successful:  ${data.item} ${data.body} ${data.status} ${data.headers}`);            }        );    }}Documentation\nAll documentation is
