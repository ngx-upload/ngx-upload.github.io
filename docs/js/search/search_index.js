Ngx-upload supports drag and drop, upload progress and manages a file upload queue for you.\nNgx-upload is bound to anyone presentation framework but you can use it with ng(x)-bootstrap or Angular Material Design without any problems.\nInstallation\nInstall through npm:\nnpm install @wkoza/ngx-uploadOR\nyarn add @wkoza/ngx-uploadSetup\nJust include ngx-upload in your root module with FormsModule or ReactiveFormsModule:\nimport {BrowserModule} from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport {NgModule} from '@angular/core';\nimport {FormsModule} from '@angular/forms';\nimport {NgxUploadModule} from '@wkoza/ngx-upload';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    FormsModule, // or ReactiveFormsModule\n    NgxUploadModule.forRoot()\n  ]\n})\nexport class AppModule {}Ngx-upload become with a mock configuration. In a real application, you must configure by declaring the configuration object UploadOptions like this :\nimport {BrowserModule} from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport {NgModule} from '@angular/core';\nimport {FormsModule} from '@angular/forms';\nimport {NgxUploadModule} from '@wkoza/ngx-upload';\n\nconst uploadOptions: UploadOptions = {\n  method : 'POST',\n  url: 'your_backend_upload_url',\n  httpStrategy: HttpClientUploadService // or XhrUploadService\n};\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    FormsModule, // or ReactiveFormsModule\n    HttpClientModule,\n    NgxUploadModule.forRoot(uploadOptions)\n  ]\n})\nexport class AppModule {}The httpStrategy property allows to specify if you wants to use HttpClient` or a simple XHR service for your upload.\nNgx-upload also proposes to configure the drop zone aspect. Then, you can change the css class of your drop zone regarding the drop event:\n\nWhen you drag a file\nWhen you drop a file\nIn other cases\n\nFor this, you should add the configuration object DropTargetOptions like this :\nimport {BrowserModule} from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport {NgModule} from '@angular/core';\nimport {FormsModule} from '@angular/forms';\nimport {NgxUploadModule} from '@wkoza/ngx-upload';\n\nconst uploadOptions: UploadOptions = {\n  method : 'POST',\n  url: 'your_backend_upload_url',\n  httpStrategy: HttpClientUploadService // or XhrUploadService\n};\n\nexport const ngxDropTargetOptions: DropTargetOptions = {\n  color: 'dropZoneColor',\n  colorDrag: 'dropZoneColorDrag',\n  colorDrop: 'dropZoneColorDrop'\n};\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    FormsModule, // or ReactiveFormsModule\n    NgxUploadModule.forRoot(uploadOptions, ngxDropTargetOptions)\n  ]\n})\nexport class AppModule {}In this example, you should also declare these css classes in your own css :\n\n.dropZoneColor {\n  border: 3px dotted rgba(0,0,0,0.08);\n  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.12)\n}\n\n.dropZoneColorDrag {\n  border: 3px dotted rgba(0,0,0,0.28);\n  background-color: grey\n}\n\n.dropZoneColorDrop {\n  border: 3px dotted rgba(0,0,0,0.08);\n  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.12)\n}Usage\nDrop zone\nNgx-upload offers one directive for your drop zone called ngxDragAndDrop. It allows to add the files in the upload queue. During the drop event, it throws an event called onDrop that you can catch :\n\n\n...\n\n\n        Drop files here to upload\n\n\n\nTo finish, we can overwrite the DropTargetOptions for a specific case due to property binding :\n\n        Drop files here to upload\nUpload queue\nEach file is added to a queue that you can manage with uploader service. Here is an example :\n  \n    Upload queue 0\"> - {{ uploader.queue.length }} item(s)\n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Upload all\n        \n        \n           Cancel all\n        \n        \n           Remove all\n        \n      \n    \n    \n\n      \n        \n        \n          Name\n          Size\n          Progress\n          Actions\n        \n        \n        \n        \n          {{ itemFile.file.name }}\n          {{ itemFile.file.size/1024/1024 | number:'1.0-2' }} MB\n          \n            \n              \n\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n               Upload\n            \n            \n             Cancel\n            \n            \n              Remove\n            \n          \n        \n        \n      \n    \n\n  Take a look at those examples for more details :\nHooks\nNgx-upload offers 5 Observable to handle a specific behavior :\n\nonCancel$ : This Observable emits when upload is canceled.\nonError$ : This Observable emits on error during the upload process.\nonSuccess$ : This Observable emits on success.\nonBeforeUploadItem$ : This Observable emits just before the upload process.\nonProgress$ : This Observable emits during the upload process.\n\nFor example :\n\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { FileItem, HttpClientUploadService } from '@wkoza/ngx-upload';\n\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'app-root',\n    templateUrl: './simple.component.html',\n    styleUrls: ['./simple.component.css']\n})\nexport class SimpleBootstrapComponent implements OnInit {\n\n    constructor(public uploader: HttpClientUploadService) { }\n\n    ngOnInit() {\n\n        this.uploader.onCancel$.subscribe(\n            (data: FileItem) => {\n                console.log('file deleted: ' + data.file);\n\n            });\n\n        this.uploader.onProgress$.subscribe(\n            (data: any) => {\n                console.log('upload file in progree: ' + data.progress);\n\n            });\n\n        this.uploader.onSuccess$.subscribe(\n            (data: any) => {\n                console.log(`upload file successful:  ${data.item} ${data.body} ${data.status} ${data.headers}`);\n\n            }\n        );\n\n\n    }\n}Documentation\nAll documentation is auto-generated from the source via compodoc and can be viewed here:\nhttps://ngx-upload.github.io/docs/\nLicense\nMIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview -
